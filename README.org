* GO RuN
  Gorn is a wrapper around dmenu. It's like dmenu_run with history. It tries to be fast.
* Todo
  - prune old paths from the cache
  - prune non-executables from the history
* Bugs
  - should use the freedesktop spec for finding the cache dir
  - should create the cache dir if it doesn't exist
